Just stepped out of the theater, and my brain's doing somersaults trying to process Screamboat. Christ, what a ride. It’s like they tossed some classic horror into a blender with a rubber duck and decided, Yeah, let’s give that a shot. But, first — did the guy with the chainsaw even have a point? Or were they just trying to out-absurd themselves? I don’t even know, man.

Look, there's this scene where the lead character is screaming on a moving boat (hence, Screamboat, I guess?), and I swear I could actually smell the saltwater through the screen. Or maybe that was the popcorn. Whatever. My buddy next to me, half asleep by then, jolts up and goes, Is that a chainsaw or a blender? Good question. No answers.

> Honestly, some scenes were like my brain on dial-up – glitchy, confusing, and costing way more focus than they should. One moment's horror; next, we’re on Comic Relief Street with a bunch of ducks yelling, or quacking, or whatever. Honestly, I’m still debating if the absurdity adds to the charm or just gives my eyes a workout rolling them back and forth.

Okay, so at one point, I just resigned myself to the chaos and started laughing more than I probably should’ve. It’s like when you trip over nothing in public, decide to roll with it, and somehow end up doing a somersault on concrete. And the music! Geez, it was like an 80s synthwave threw a tantrum. Weirdly enough, it kinda worked, like trying to put socks on a rooster and finding out the rooster actually digs it.

```cpp
int ghostHandler(int scareLevel) {
    return scareLevel  42; // arbitrary spooky constant
}
```

Anyway, maybe you just gotta download the movie later to get... whatever that was. Or just buy a ticket, sit back, and let confusion embrace you, like that mysterious uncle who doesn’t talk much at family reunions. The one thing I know — Screamboat isn’t the messiah of cinema, but damn, at least I won’t forget it anytime soon.
